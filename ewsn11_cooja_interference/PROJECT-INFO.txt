===============
How to run it:
===============
1. Enter the frossi-scanner folder and modify build.xml accordingly
2. Compile the frossi-scanner (ant jar)
3. Enter the cooja_configuration folder and modify build.xml accordingly
4. Compile the cooja_configuration (ant jar)
5. Start up COOJA at contiki-2.x/tools/cooja with ant clean && ant jar & ant
6. Configure COOJA to load both the frossi-scanner and the cooja_configuration projects
(Menu -> Settings -> COOJA Projects -> select both projects and make sure the frossi-scanner is loaded before cooja_configuration -> Save as default -> Restart COOJA)
7. Open and reconfigure the *.csc files 
(Menu -> File -> Open simulation -> Open and Reconfigure -> Browse)
Make sure that all Application mote types point to the correct .class files

=======
Usage:
=======
1. You should see a visualizer with the brand new "Interference skin" activated.
The skin's purpose is twofold: it provides icons separating regular Contiki motes from interferers, and it provides right-mouse-click menu for activating/deactivating the interferers. The current version does not remember activity state: the interferers will always be deactivated when the simulation is loaded.

2. Start the simulation. The frossi-scanner should immediately start showing (simulated) RSSI traces. Try moving nodes closer/further away from the frossi-scanner node (ear-like clipart).

3. To record an interference trace use the recording_interference application and place the generated trace in the cooja_configuration\traces accordingly.

4. For the ewsn_collect.csc use contiki-2.x\examples\sky-shell\sky-shell.c

5. Make sure that contiki/tools/cooja/apps/collect-view is in Settings->Cooja projects before the other two
